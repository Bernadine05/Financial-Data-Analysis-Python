# Financial-Data-Analysis-Python

## Project Overview

The project looks to identify how various factors inform and influence Investments. The tool used for this analysis was Python. I used Python to import the data, clean it and create visualizations that showed the main investment avenues per gender, the correlation between age and purpose for investments and how often investments are made.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (Problems to solve)

This analysis seeks to answer the questions below:
- What factors are mainly considered when people of different ages and genders make financial decisions? 
- How often do people invest?
- Why do many people invest?
- Which gender invests more in investment avenues?
- At what age are most people investing?
  

## Methodology

- Python - conducted a more detailed analysis in Python and created visualisations showcasing the areas the most influenced and informed investments

## Skills

- Python - Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to handle missing data, perform numerical operations, and create interactive visualizations 

## Results
